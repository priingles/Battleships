2nd trimester 2024/2025 DSA Coursework

To earn a better grade there are some additional requirements:
• Your game should record the history of play and allow earlier
games to be automatically re-played from this record, i.e. the
sequence of moves that the player(s) make during a game, so
that each game that is played can be recorded and re-played.
Subsequent automatic replaying a record of an earlier game from
the record is a part of this requirement.
• Your game should support undo, i.e. once a move is made you
should be able to un-apply it, returning the game state to the
immediate previous state. Your players should be able to undo
moves right back to the initial game state.
• Once an undo facility is working your game can be extended to
support redo of moves that have been undone.
• Extra options to be considered. Options like playing against time.
For example, 7 minutes to finish the game.
